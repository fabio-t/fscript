/**
 * This basic function of this class is to return a Method
 * object for a particular class given the name of a method
 * and the parameters to the method in the form of an Object[]
 *
 * The first time the Introspector sees a
 * class it creates a class method map for the
 * class in question. Basically the class method map
 * is a Hastable where Method objects are keyed by a
 * concatenation of the method name and the names of
 * classes that make up the parameters.
 *
 * For example, a method with the following signature:
 *
 * public void method(String a, StringBuffer b)
 *
 * would be mapped by the key:
 *
 * "method" + "java.lang.String" + "java.lang.StringBuffer"
