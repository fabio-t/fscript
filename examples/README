Some simple examples, a correctly set classpath (pointing to FScript.jar) 
will help with compiling and running.

All examples are also covered by LGPL (see ../COPYING).

Current examples:

processing/Processing.java - simple document processing with FScript 
	(to run - java Processing processing.script).

extension/ExtensionExample.java - simple example of an FScript Extension 
	(to run - java ExtensionExample extension.script).

callfunc/CallFunc.java - example of use of get/getScriptVar and
	callScriptFunction
	(to run - java CallFunc)

objects/Object.java - example of using the FSReflectionExtension 
	to access Java objects
	(to run - java Objects)
