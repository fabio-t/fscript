FScript
=======

FScript is an extremely simple scripting language.  
Its intended use is as an embedded language in other Java programs.  
It is not a complete programming language. If you need one of these I suggest
you look at:

	JPython - 	http://www.jpython.org - an implementation 
				of the excellent Python language in Java.

	Rhino - 	http://www.mozilla.org/rhino - an implementation
				of JavaScript in Java.

Both of these are also fully embedable, and have sane licenses.

FScript however is around 60k as a jar file, and is only a few thousand
lines of source.  So if the functionality you are looking for is more
than a simple configuration file parser, but less than a full blown programming
language FScript could be for you.

The only requirement is a Java 2 runtime environment.

It is licensed under the LGPL.

See the 'docs' directory for more information.
