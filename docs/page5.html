<h2>Driving FScript</h2>


<a name="link0"></a><h4>Using FScript in your code</h4>

<p>A number of methods exist to enable your application to load FScript code into FScript, and
have FScript execute it.  These are:
<li>load</li>

<li>loadLine</li>

<li>run</li>

<li>reset</li>

<li>cont</li>

<li>getError</li>
</p>


<p><b>load</b>
</p>

<p>The <i>load</i>
 method is used to load a complete FScript source from a Reader.  This is the
technique used by FSTest.java.  </p>


<p><b>loadLine</b>
</p>

<p><i>loadLine</i>
 loads one line (as a String) at a time into FScript.  
This is the technique used by theDocProc.java example.</p>


<p><b>run</b>
</p>

<p>This method executes the loaded FScript code (from the start of the code to the end).  If any
errors are encountered it will throw a FSException.  The method <i>getError</i>
 could then
be called to gain more error information if necessary</p>

<p>If there is a <i>return</i>
 statement in the top level of the executed FScript, <i>run</i>

will return the value specified in the <i>return</i>
 statement (either an Integer, String or Double).
</p>

<p><b>reset</b>
</p>

<p>This method resets FScript - removing any previously loaded code.</p>


<p><b>cont</b>
</p>

<p>This method continues execution of fscript from the current code position to the end of
the script</p>

<p>This is useful for document processing applications where code such as :</p>

<pre>

	fscript.loadLine(line[1]);
	fscript.loadLine(line[2]);
	...
	fscript.run();
	fscript.loadLine(line[19]);
	fscript.loadLine(line[20]);
	...
	fscript.cont();
</pre>

<p>In the above example the call to <i>cont</i>
 simply restarts execution at the end
of the previous run, and continues to the (current) end of the script.  It is safe to use
<i>cont</i>
 as your first call to execute code, so in the above example the first <i>run</i>

could just have well have been a <i>cont</i>
.</p>

<p>If there is a <i>return</i>
 statement in the top level of the executed FScript, <i>cont</i>

will return the value specified in the <i>return</i>
 statement (either an Integer, String or Double).
</p>


<p><b>evaluateExpression</b>
</p>

<p>This method returns the result of evaluating the FScript expression passed as a string.
If a script has previously been loaded and run, this expression is evaluated in the context
of the previous script, so variables and functions defined in the script will be available.</p>

<p>For example if no previous script had been run and
<pre>fs.evaluateExpression("1+2+3")</pre>

was called, it would return an <i>Integer</i>
 with a value of 6</p>

<p>However if a previous script had defined <i>int</i>
 variables 'a' and 'b' with values
4 and 3 then 
<pre>fs.evaluateExpression("a+b-2")</pre>

would return an <i>Integer</i>
 with a value of 5</p>


<p><b>getError</b>
</p>

<p>See the JavaDoc for full details of get error.  This method returns more information about
a FSException condition - this is the same information available in the message of an FSException
 but structured to make it easy to process programatically.</p>



<a name="link1"></a><h4>Accessing Script Variables/Functions</h4>

<p>As of FScript version 1.0 it is possible for the host application to access
FScript level variables and functions. There is an example showing this
in the <i>examples</i>
 directory. Note that these functions will only work
<b>after</b>
 the script has been executed (via <i>run</i>
 or<i>cont</i>
).  In 
in some cases it may make sense to have a script only containing functions and
global variable declarations, and then manipulate these via the methods
described below.</p>

<p>There are three methods provided to allow access:
<ul>
<li>callScriptFunction</li>

<li>setScriptVar</li>

<li>getScriptVar</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p><b>callScriptFunction</b>
</p>

<p>callScript function executes a FSCript function, it takes two parameters,
the name of the function (a String) and a list of parameters (an ArrayList).
In order for the call to succeed the function with the name (case sensitive)
must exist and there must be the correct number and type of parameters (in
the same order they were defined).  The return value is the returned Object
(if any).</p>

<p><b>set/getScriptVar</b>
</p>

<p>These functions allow access to script level variables.  getScriptVar returns
the Object which is associated with the script level variable with the name that
is passed as a parameter.  setScriptVar sets the script level variable with
the name passed as a parameter to the given Object.
</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>
</p>

<p>As with all FScript methods the Object parameters are restricted to the 
subset supported by FScript itself (currently String, Integer and Double).
It is also important to note that if a call is made to any of these methods
with the name of a variable/function that is not defined by the script, FScript
will behave <b>exactly</b>
 as it would if that call had been made from within
a script and make calls to getVar/setVar/callFunction.  This could be especially
problematic if the script access calls are made from within one of the handler
methods (getVar/setVar/callFunction).</p>
