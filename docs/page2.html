<h2>Installation</h2>


<a name="link0"></a><h4>Installation</h4>


<p>FScript is supplied as a gzipped tar file.  Under a suitable Unix it 
can be extracted with the command <i> tar -xvzf FScript.tgz </i>
</p>


<p> Windows users should find that a utility such as Winzip can handle 
this file, but they may have to extract the tar file, rename it with a 
.tar extension and then use Winzip (or the like) again</p>


<p>FScript is a component that is not really useful as a stand alone language,
hence the method of installation is typically up to you - the source files
are located in the 'murlen' directory, the class files in the class directory, and
there should be a .jar file suitable for inclusion in you CLASSPATH in the
top level directory.  The documentation, including javadoc, is in the docs
directory.</p>


<p><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Ant</a>
 is the preferred build tool 
for compiling the code (should you wish to do so).  There are a number of 
targets:
<br></br>
all - makes all source files (if needed)
<br></br>
clean - removes class files
<br></br>
jar - builds the jar file
<br></br>
jdoc - rebuilds the javadoc
<br></br>
test - runs java FSTest regtest.script (system self test)
<br></br>
theworks - rebuilds everything (runs clean,all,jar,jdoc,test)
</p>

<p>There is also a Makefile, which currently has the same targets, but
make is being phased out in favor of Ant, so in future versions the
Makefile may not exist.</p>


<p>There is a test FScript script (regtest.script) which is intended to 
exercise most if not all of the language.  
This can be executed by running <i> java FSTest regtest.script </i>
.
</p>

<p>There are some (very simple) examples of FScript use in the 
<i>examples</i>
 directory (and subdirectories).</p>
