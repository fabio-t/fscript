<h2>Introduction</h2>







<a name="link0"></a><h4>What is FScript?</h4>

<p>FScript is an extremely simple scripting language.  
Its intended use is as an embedded language in other Java programs. It is
very simple to embed - it can be a matter of sub-classing one class and adding your
own functionality. However is not a complete programming language, i.e no 
libraries (for IO etc.) are provided. These are expected to be provided by the
hosting application.</p>

<p>For a complete language I suggest you look at:</p>

<p>

<a href="http://www.jython.org">jython</a>
 - an implementation of 
	the excellent Python language in Java.<br></br>


<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino">Rhino</a>
 - an implementation
				of JavaScript in Java.<br></br>

</p>

<p>Both of these are also fully embeddable, and have sane licenses.</p>

<p>FScript however is around 50k as a jar file, and is only a few thousand
lines of source.  So if the functionality you are looking for is more
than a simple configuration file parser, but less than a full blown programming
language FScript could be for you.</p>

<p>As of version 1.1 FScript has the ability to access Java objects directly.  
That is it is possible to instance a Java object and access it's methods and fields
from within a FScript script. This gives FScript a lot more power than it previously had.
This feature is also modular and can be removed if not needed</p>




<a name="link1"></a><h4>Features</h4>

<p>A quick rundown of FScript's features:
<ul>
<li>Three supported data types (string,integer,double)</li>

<li>Conditional execution ('if' statements)</li>

<li>Loops ('while')</li>

<li>Functions (including recursive functions)</li>

<li>Local & global variable scope</li>

<li>The usual range of logic and math operators.</li>

<li>Simple to extend either by sub-classing or 'plug-in' like extensions</li>

<li>Able to interact with Java objects.</li>

</ul>

</p>




<a name="link2"></a><h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>
The only requirement is a Java2 runtime environment.  An initial version of 
FScript also exists for J2ME. For details so the FScript
